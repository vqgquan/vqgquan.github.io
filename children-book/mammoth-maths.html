                <p>
                    David Macaulay, a renowned author and illustrator, has created a unique aid to mathematics.


                </p>

                <p>
                    Math is everywhere...if you look attentively enough! Mathematics is genuinely pervasive, from
                    computer games to bridges to shopping malls and game shows. David Macauley's fantastic ensemble of
                    inquisitive mammoths will guide children ages 8 and up through the fundamentals of mathematics,
                    including numbers, calculation, geometry, and measurement.


                </p>
                <p>
                    In Mammoth Maths, you will not only learn the fundamentals of mathematics, but you will also
                    appreciate doing so! The mammoths are your guide from beginning to end as they endeavor to
                    comprehend mathematics!

                </p>
                <p>
                    These intrepid demonstrators will go to extraordinary measures to educate and entertain as they
                    grapple with adding or subtracting numbers, measuring angles, creating a pie chart, and solving
                    equations, among other mathematical challenges.
                    David Macaulay, a best-selling illustrator, observes and records the mammoths' behavior. Macaulay
                    captures the oddball humor of his subject matter, making Mammoth Maths the ideal introduction to
                    mathematics for young learners. Macaulay is renowned for his ability to explain complex concepts
                    with straightforward genius.

                <p>
                    Discover mathematics as you've never known it with:
                    <br>

                    -Fun-filled illustrations depict Macaulay's mammoths investigating mathematical concepts in unusual
                    and amusing ways, demonstrating fundamental mathematical principles.
                    <br>
                    - An exciting alternative to dry and unappealing mathematics manuals.
                    <br>
                    -Supporting panels include diagrams and additional information to facilitate comprehension.
                    <br>
                    -The book is divided into chapters, each of which focuses on a distinct area of mathematics.
                    <br>
                    Over 60 topics, including numbers, geometry, measurement, and operations, are covered in Mammoth
                    Maths, making it the ideal maths book for all children aged 8 and up, as well as for reluctant maths
                    learners who don't believe maths is for them. Comprises brand-new illustrations of Macaulay's
                    signature mammoths, which are familiar to readers of The Way Things Work, a best-selling book by
                    David Macaulay that has sold over three million copies worldwide!

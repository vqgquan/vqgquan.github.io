                    The Mark of Athena is the spectacular third installment in the bestselling series Heroes of Olympus
                    by Rick Riordan. One fatal prophecy, seven courageous demigods, and a mission to locate and shut the
                    portals of death. Annabeth felt as if a frigid washcloth had been draped around her neck. She heard
                    the presence's whispered mirth again, as if it had followed her off the ship. She viewed the Argo II
                    from above. Its enormous bronze hull glistened in the sun. A portion of her desired to immediately
                    abduct Percy, board the ship, and flee the area while they still could. She could not escape the
                    feeling that something terrible was about to occur. She was unable to risk losing Percy once more.
                    Rick Riordan Is The Master of Myths - The Greek Gods are alive and well - ""A terrific read"" The
                    Sunday Express. (Big Question) "Explosive" ""Action-packed"". (Telegraph). Rick Riordan is a
                    multi-award-winning author of mysteries. His wife and two sons reside with him in San Antonio,
                    Texas. In 2006, Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Rick's first novel featuring the heroic
                    juvenile demigod, won the Red House Children's Book Award for overall excellence.
